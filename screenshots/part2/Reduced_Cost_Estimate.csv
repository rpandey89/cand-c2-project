"Reconfiguration Done:
1. Changed the pricing model for c5 instances to c5a.xlarge and standard reserved 3 yr from on-demand as the number of instances will be almost fixed throughout the year
2. Changed the instance class for database from db.m4.4xlarge to db.m6g.4xlarge that uses Amazon Graviton2 processors and should be able to provide decent performance as per the docs. Kept the pricing model for db instances to reserved 1 yr from on-demand as the number of instances will be almost fixed throughout the year",,,,,,,,
